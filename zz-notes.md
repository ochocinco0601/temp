Critical Thinking: The "Good Enough" Paradox

  What I'm Seeing in Those Dashboards

  Both images show the absolute minimum viable BOS:
  - ONE business SLI (Wire Transfer Success Rate)
  - Simple current vs target comparison
  - Basic business context (what it does, why it matters)
  - Clear ownership (who to call)

  That's it. No complexity. No multiple SLIs. No elaborate impact calculations.

  The Overthinking Trap You're In

  Your repo has:
  - 51-field data model
  - Multiple impact categories (Customer/Financial/Legal/Operational)
  - Complex CSV relationships
  - Multiple SLI capability per service
  - Sophisticated factory model

  But the dashboards that prove value show:
  - Maybe 10-15 fields actually displayed
  - ONE SLI that answers ONE question
  - Simple OK/WARNING/BREACH status

  Critical Insight: Start vs Scale

  "Good Enough" to START (prove BOS works):
  - One SLI per service
  - Business context visible
  - Current vs Target shown
  - Simple status indicator

  "Good Enough" to SCALE (enterprise-ready):
  - Your 51-field model
  - Multiple SLIs per service
  - Full impact assessment
  - Complete factory process

  The Real Question for Joe

  Is success:

  A) Minimum Viable Proof
  "Each service has ONE dashboard showing ONE business-relevant SLI with context"
  - Effort: 1 week
  - Complexity: Low
  - Risk: Almost none
  - Value: Proves the concept

  B) Comprehensive Implementation
  "Each service has multiple SLIs, full impact assessment, complete business context"
  - Effort: 3+ months
  - Complexity: High
  - Risk: Significant
  - Value: Production-ready system

  My PM/PO Assessment

  You're conflating two different problems:

  1. Proving BOS value = Simple dashboards with 1 SLI each
  2. Building BOS infrastructure = Complete 51-field enterprise system

  For J's performance goal, you probably only need #1. The "coordination with business and tech partners" could be demonstrated by:
  - Business partner: "I defined what success means" (1 SLI)
  - Tech partner: "I implemented the query" (1 query)
  - Dashboard: "Here's the business view" (1 simple dashboard)

  The "Good Enough" Test

  Would an ops engineer during an incident find value in:
  - Seeing "Wire Transfer Success Rate: 94% (Target 99.5%) - WARNING"
  - Knowing "Homebuyers cannot complete purchase"
  - Having owner contact: "sarah.chen@company.com"

  If YES, then that simple dashboard IS good enough to demonstrate BOS value.

  Critical Question

  Are you building:
  - Version 1.0 (prove it works) - Simple, 1 SLI, basic context
  - Version 10.0 (enterprise scale) - Complete, multiple SLIs, full model

  Your performance goal probably only requires v1.0, but your perfectionism is demanding v10.0.

  Which version would prove to J that BOS is working?
