---

## Part 3: Multi-Row Impact Assessment Structure

### 3.1 Design Pattern

The impact assessment table uses a **one-row-per-category** pattern that enables comprehensive business impact modeling:

- **One service** → **1-4 impact assessment rows**
- **Each row** represents **one impact category**
- **Field usage** varies by **category type**

### 3.2 Impact Categories and Field Patterns

| Category | Required Fields | Optional Fields | Query Field | Example Stakeholder |
|----------|-----------------|-----------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **customer_experience** | stakeholderType, stakeholderCount | - | customerImpactQuery | homebuyers, loan applicants |
| **financial** | financialImpact | stakeholderType | financialImpactQuery | company |
| **legal_risk** | regulatoryImpact | - | legalRiskQuery | company |
| **operational** | stakeholderType, stakeholderCount | - | operationalImpactQuery | loan processors, support teams |

### 3.3 Real Data Examples

**SVC001 (Treasury Service) - 2 Impact Categories:**
```
Row 1: customer_experience → homebuyers (850 daily) → Wire fails → Cannot close
Row 2: financial → company → Wire fails → Lost revenue ($380,000 average)
```

**SVC002 (Credit Check) - 4 Impact Categories:**
```
Row 1: customer_experience → loan applicants (2000 daily) → Check fails → Stuck process
Row 2: financial → company → Check fails → Lost origination ($50,000 average)
Row 3: legal_risk → company → Timing violation → CFPB fines
Row 4: operational → processors (50 people) → Manual intervention → Reduced capacity
```

**SVC003 (Payment API) - 2 Impact Categories:**
```
Row 1: customer_experience → borrowers (12,000 monthly) → Slow API → Frustration
Row 2: operational → customer service (25 reps) → Slow API → Increased calls
```

### 3.4 Validation Rules

**Required for ALL rows:**
- service_id, impactCategory, failureScenario, businessConsequence

**Category-specific requirements:**
- customer_experience: stakeholderType + customerImpactQuery
- financial: financialImpact + financialImpactQuery
- legal_risk: regulatoryImpact + legalRiskQuery
- operational: stakeholderType + operationalImpactQuery

**NULL strategy:**
- Leave irrelevant fields empty/NULL
- Example: customer_experience rows should omit financialImpact

## Part 5: Data Lineage and Validation

### 5.1 Data Lineage Validation System

The BOS implementation includes a comprehensive data lineage validator that traces data from CSV source through SQLite database to dashboard panels.

**Validation Stages:**
1. **CSV Parsing**: Validates file structure and field completeness
2. **Database Queries**: Confirms data transformation accuracy
3. **Field Mapping**: Traces specific fields from source to display
4. **Data Consistency**: Validates record counts and relationships
5. **Summary Report**: Provides actionable integrity metrics

**Current Performance:**
- ✅ 4/5 validations pass consistently
- ❌ 1 known issue: CSV parser vs database discrepancy (resolved in database)
- ✅ 100% field mapping accuracy
- ✅ Complete metrics generation (577 records per service)

### 5.2 Testing Results Summary

**SVC001 (Wire Transfer Service):**
- Service Type: Ratio metric (success rate)
- Impact Categories: 2 (customer_experience, financial)
- Data Integrity: 4/5 validations passed
- Metrics Generated: 577 records

**SVC002 (Credit Check Service):**
- Service Type: Ratio metric (success rate)
- Impact Categories: 4 (all categories)
- Data Integrity: 4/5 validations passed

**SVC003 (Payment API Service):**
- Service Type: Threshold metric (response time)
- Impact Categories: 2 (customer_experience, operational)
- Data Integrity: 4/5 validations passed
- Metrics Generated: 577 records

### 5.3 Proven Data Patterns

**Ratio Metrics Pattern (SVC001, SVC002):**
```
sliType: ratioMetric
goodEventsCriteria_PO: Business definition of success
goodEventsCriteria_Dev: Technical query for success events
totalEventsCriteria_PO: Business definition of scope
totalEventsCriteria_Dev: Technical query for total events
```

**Threshold Metrics Pattern (SVC003):**
```
sliType: thresholdMetric
thresholdQuery_Dev: Query for metric value
thresholdOperator: lt (less than)
thresholdValue: 2000 (milliseconds)
```

## Part 6: Practical Implementation Guidance

### 6.1 Adding New Services - Step by Step

1. **Generate Unique Service ID**
   ```
   Format: SVC00X (increment from existing)
   Example: SVC004
   ```

2. **Populate Core Service Information** (services.csv)
   ```csv
   SVC004,loan-origination-api,Loan Origination API,Process new loan applications,internal,2,Home Lending,What percentage of loan applications are processed successfully?,lending;origination,jane.doe@company.com
   ```

3. **Define SLI Measurement** (sli_definitions.csv)
   - Choose sliType: ratioMetric or thresholdMetric
   - Populate criteria fields based on type
   - Include data source connection details

4. **Set SLO Targets** (slo_configurations.csv)
   - Define business-justified targets
   - Set alerting thresholds
   - Choose time window and budgeting method

5. **Document Business Impact** (impact_assessments.csv)
   - Create 1-4 rows (one per relevant impact category)
   - Follow field usage patterns by category
   - Include appropriate query fields

6. **Add Operational Metadata** (operational_metadata.csv)
   - Include notification channels
   - Link to dashboards and runbooks
   - Set lifecycle status to 'active'

7. **Regenerate Database and Validate**
   ```bash
   python3 pipeline/csv_to_sqlite.py
   node grafana/grafana-panel-tools/validate-data-lineage.js --service=SVC004
   ```

### 6.2 Field Validation Checklist

**Required Fields Check:**
- [ ] service_id unique across all tables
- [ ] displayName and businessPurpose populated
- [ ] sliType matches criteria fields (ratio vs threshold)
- [ ] sloTarget has business justification
- [ ] impactCategory uses valid enum values
- [ ] Query fields match impact categories

**Relationship Integrity:**
- [ ] service_id exists in services.csv before use
- [ ] Impact assessments have 1-4 rows per service
- [ ] SLI type matches populated criteria fields
- [ ] Alert thresholds are logical (page < alert < target)

### 6.3 Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**❌ Problem: CSV field names displayed in dashboard**
✅ Solution: Use display names, not storage field names

**❌ Problem: Impact assessment parsing errors**
✅ Solution: Ensure exact field count matches header

**❌ Problem: Missing foreign key relationships**
✅ Solution: Always populate service_id first in services.csv

**❌ Problem: Threshold vs ratio confusion**
