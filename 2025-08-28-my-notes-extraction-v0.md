# Source Context (Date: August 28, 2025)

A leadership-prep monologue clarifying why “technical health ≠ business health,” arguing that business observability must be defined and owned by product/business, and sketching a minimal, experiment-driven path (templates → telemetry → dashboards/alerts) to enable better decisions.&#x20;

## The Core Problem

1. **Summary:** Technical status dashboards don’t reveal whether customer or business goals are being met.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “This is telling us that the systems are up and running. But it's not telling us if the customers are happy, or if we're making money.”&#x20;

2. **Summary:** Business health objectives are hard to define, which blocks precise measurement and alerting.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Business Health. Objectives. Are difficult to Define.”&#x20;

3. **Summary:** Culture and engagement are preconditions; a purely mechanical rollout will fail.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Humanless change fails.”&#x20;

4. **Summary:** Current incident response relies on tribal knowledge, causing slow business-impact clarity.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Today, we rely on. Individuals. And their knowledge… A lot of time has gone by. During a. Production incident.”&#x20;

## New Mental Models

1. **Summary:** Observability’s essence is detecting change (planned/unplanned), not just collecting data.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Observability is fundamentally about detecting change… detecting. Plan changes. And unplanned changes.”&#x20;

2. **Summary:** Define flows from the entry point of customer/business intent; each initiable goal is a “flow.”
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Business observability… Primarily. Defined. From the perspective of the entry point.”
   * “Any time… we can initiate… a customer goal… That. Is a flow.”&#x20;

3. **Summary:** Treat BOS as schema-first: a system of record enabling “observability as code.”
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “We have a schema. We have. Structured data… Observability is code… Alerting as code. Dashboards as code. Reporting is code.”&#x20;

4. **Summary:** Compounding decisions: better visibility leads to repeated higher-value choices over time.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Choosing. Feature. Over feature. Because you now have data… Accumulation of those types of… Positive decisions. Is huge.”&#x20;

## Counter-argument Analysis

1. **Summary:** Misconception: “System up” implies “business is fine.” Rebuttal: technical ≠ business outcomes.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Technical health is not equal to business health. I should probably repeat that.”&#x20;

2. **Summary:** Misconception: BOS can be mandated via pipeline gates alone. Rebuttal: mandates without buy-in fail.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “We could have… \[a] delivery pipeline… that looked for… Business Health… But humanless change fails.”&#x20;

3. **Summary:** Misconception: SLOs are purely technical. Rebuttal: business rules and completion timeliness must anchor them.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “It's expected that all of the. Funds to transfer for a given day. Are successfully processed… \[and] 90 percent… are processed \[within] X amount of time?”&#x20;

## Content and Communication Principles

1. **Summary:** Keep examples simple and crisp; avoid losing focus with exhaustive benefit lists.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “They don't have to be deep or complex. They can be simple.”
   * “My story is losing focus, certainly losing crispness… it would have to be very crisp.”&#x20;

2. **Summary:** Anchor on decision enablement and feedback loops, not tool features.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “It facilitates making decisions.”
   * “Providing. Near real time data. For a feedback loop to the business.”&#x20;

3. **Summary:** Reiterate the core message to drive adoption.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Technical health does not equal business health.”&#x20;

## Process and Collaborative Insights

1. **Summary:** Three-party contract: Product defines/owns requirements, Dev implements telemetry, Platform operationalizes visualization/alerting/incident workflows.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Business and product… define the requirements. Our development team implements… And the platform operations team… Visualizing. And alerting. And Incident Management.”&#x20;

2. **Summary:** Start minimally with a template-driven SoR, then iterate as experiments with retrospectives.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “Product owner filling out their template… The developer implements… data… The operations team facilitates… playbooks and dashboards and alerts.”
   * “Because these are experiments?… I don't know if retrospectives is the right word. But this is what we learned.”&#x20;

3. **Summary:** Tie upstream/downstream services to an end-to-end business flow with roll-up health signals.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “If each of the downstream Services had their own technical \[signals]… and… roll up. For an overall status.”&#x20;

4. **Summary:** Use hard completion realities (e.g., wires/trades must be 100%) to shape business SLOs and alerts.
   **Literal Insight:**

   * “There's no such thing as? Not completing a wire transfer. Every single one must be done.”&#x20;

## Gap Analysis

* Missing explicit acceptance criteria and named metrics for “business health” per flow (e.g., concrete SLIs/SLO thresholds, data sources, and time windows).&#x20;
* No prioritization rubric for which flows to start with (scope is “Huge!” but lacks a selection framework or ROI screen).&#x20;
* Governance unresolved: who approves definitions, who maintains the SoR, and how changes propagate across Dev/Platform/Business.&#x20;
* Operating cadence unspecified (how often to review trends, run retrospectives, and recalibrate rules).&#x20;
* Tooling/data plumbing unspecified (where metrics live, how to stitch across services, how to detect “silent degradation”).&#x20;
* Stakeholder engagement plan is implied but not concrete (asks for advocacy but lacks an enablement/communications plan by persona).&#x20;
