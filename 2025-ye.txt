# WORKDAY FIELD 1: Successes and Achievements

Goal 1: Business Observability

Built BOS framework in first iteration development, positioned for year-end pilot launch.

Core Framework Delivered:
• Logic Model & Semantic Flow defining how business goals become measurable requirements with validation built-in
• Six-step structured process (Define Flow → Populate Templates → Build Signal Matrix → Create Playbooks → Generate Dashboards → Ensure Traceability) as repeatable factory model
• Delivery contract model establishing joint accountability across Product, Development, and Platform SRE
• Signal taxonomy distinguishing Business/Process/System signals to eliminate "technical green, business red" confusion

Flow Progress (positioned for year-end completion):
• Funding Service: Business signal design and impact assessment framework complete (Customer/Financial/Legal/Operational impact categories)
• Loan Rate Amendment: Flow mapping initiated with app dev partners
• Third flow: Candidate pool established across Trading, Loan Originations, Customer Experience, Loan Servicing

Key Deliverables:
• BOS Step Template, Persona Role Guide, Coverage Tracker, Impact Panel (March-July)
• CT Hierarchical Navigation dashboard framing (CT → L4 → L3 → App ID → Service) for Start-of-Day visibility
• Business Impact Instance prompt enabling Product Owners to define measurable outcomes
• White paper sections establishing BOS principles

Strategic Pivot:
When Product Owner time constraints created bottlenecks, pivoted to leverage existing telemetry with BOS semantic enrichment, maintaining momentum.

Presented BOS vision to App Dev CIO (April 2025). Framework well-received across Technology leadership.

Goal 2: Improve our Reliability Posture

Built framework to measure mortgage lending stability in business terms, not just technical uptime.

What I Built:
• Business signals with thresholds for funding service (Aug 2025): Measures customer experience (loans funded by deadline) vs. technical metrics (API response time)
• Signal Matrix: All products now categorize signals as Business/Process/System, so teams define "healthy" consistently
• Start-of-Day business health view: Shows whether business functions are working (loans processing, trades executing) not just whether systems are up

Alert Quality:
Email alert reduction (Goal 6) eliminated 92% of noise, improving signal quality and response effectiveness for reliability measurement.

Migration Context:
Framework measures loan success rates and funding completion during cloud migrations, answering "Is this delivering business value?" not just "Is it running?" This enables tracking stability improvements as products modernize.

Goal 3: Living Our Company Expectations

Embrace Candor: Named "business health vs. troubleshooting" confusion directly. Created Signal Taxonomy with examples to clarify distinction across teams.

Do What's Right: Championed elimination of email-only alerts as safety issue despite cultural resistance. Advocated for business goals as explicit requirements.

Be Great at Execution: Delivered BOS framework components iteratively (templates Mar-Jul, dashboards Sep-Oct, Splunk alert dashboard Oct 7, CT Navigation framing Oct 31). Worked to adopt faster delivery cadence responding to manager feedback.

Learn and Grow: Researched user story mapping to improve requirements gathering approach. Incorporated feedback on matching message to audience (technical depth for SRE partners, business outcomes for executive briefings).

Champion Inclusive Environment: Engaged Product Owners, App Dev directors, Platform SRE teams across multiple L3 domains ensuring diverse perspectives shaped BOS framework.

Goal 4: Observability, User Journey, and Service Level Objects

Designed business signals for multi-product customer experience flows.

Given organizational maturity, focused on establishing signals with thresholds rather than formal SLO/SLI frameworks.

What I Delivered:
• Selected specific mortgage lending business functions (funding service, loan rate amendment) as focus areas for business signal design
• Designed business signals measuring customer experience ("scheduled closings funded by 8 AM" with alert thresholds)
• Built signal mockups and contextual panel patterns (Sep 6-12) visualizing business outcomes, not just system telemetry
• Created Signal Matrix categorizing telemetry (metrics, events, traces, alerts, logs) by Business/Process/System layers for different personas

Impact: Clear line of sight from user journey → business signal → dashboard → alert, answering "Is software doing what business needs?" not just "Is it running?"

---

Goal 5: Promoting Partnership

Built effective cross-functional relationships demonstrating business understanding.

Executive Engagement:
Presented BOS to App Dev CIO (April 2025). Maintained regular strategic alignment with Platform Operations and SRE leadership throughout 2025.

Cross-Functional Collaboration:
• Product Owners and Business SMEs across Trading, Loan Originations, Customer Experience, Loan Servicing
• App Dev directors and Platform Support leads through daily Start-of-Day cadence
• Enterprise observability platform teams (Splunk, AppDynamics) for tooling integration

Recognition: Manager feedback (May) noted BOS "well received from peers across Technology organization" and email alert work "well received." Continued value for "skills, execution, and institutional knowledge."

---

Goal 6: Reduce Email Alerts

Exceeded 80% stretch goal: 98% incident management compliance, 92% email volume reduction.

Results:
• Jan 2025: 76% compliance, 1,362 emails
• Oct 2025: 98% compliance, ~109 emails
• Achievement: 22-point improvement, 92% volume reduction

What I Built:
• Email Alert Get Well Program (Mar-Apr) with executive support, clear policy eliminating email as alert action
• Splunk dashboard (Oct 7) identifying violations by App ID with editable remediation links
• Central event pipeline routing to enterprise incident management platform (urgent → page, non-urgent → ServiceNow)

Sustainability: Transitioned to Mission Control maintenance phase by mid-year.

Impact:
• Reduced risk of missed critical incidents due to email noise
• Improved response effectiveness through proper routing
• Aligned practices with enterprise risk appetite

---

Summary

Key Themes:
• Exceeded measurable goals: 98% vs 80% email target
• Built strategic framework: BOS positioned for year-end pilot with delivery contracts, signal taxonomy, six-step process
• Responded to feedback: Shifted to two-week cycles, prioritized momentum over exhaustive documentation
• Cross-functional engagement: Product, Dev, Platform SRE, Executive levels

# WORKDAY FIELD 2: Areas of Focus

Presentation and Communication Skills:
Continue refining ability to match message complexity to audience. Made progress tailoring technical depth for SRE partners vs. business outcomes for executive briefings, but there's opportunity to further develop this skill through training or coaching. Goal is to deliver presentations where the audience immediately understands the value proposition without needing multiple iterations.

Execution Velocity and Iterative Delivery:
Build on mid-year shift toward faster delivery cycles. Successfully delivered consumable outputs (templates, dashboards, mockups) on regular cadence, but maintaining consistent momentum remains a focus area. Continue prioritizing "good enough to ship" over exhaustive documentation while ensuring quality standards.

Requirements Gathering and Stakeholder Facilitation:
Deepen product management and requirements gathering capabilities. Researched user story mapping and applied structured approaches to capturing business observability requirements from Product Owners. As BOS scales, need stronger facilitation skills to efficiently extract business context from diverse stakeholders across multiple L3 domains.

Strategic Focus:
Balance deep technical work with broader organizational influence. Continue building frameworks and standards that enable systematic adoption while ensuring execution doesn't get stuck in planning cycles. Maintain adaptability to pivot when constraints require pragmatic solutions.

# WORKDAY FIELD 3: Risk Overlay

Compliance and Policy Adherence:
• Completed all required risk and compliance training by due dates
• Championed email alert elimination policy aligning operational practices with enterprise risk appetite
• Ensured all BOS monitoring routes through central enterprise event pipeline with proper escalation procedures

Risk-Conscious Decision Making:
• Email alert reduction program directly addressed operational risk (missed critical incidents due to noise)
• BOS framework treats business goals as explicit requirements with validation, preventing "assumed success" without evidence
• Business signal definitions prevent "green technical systems, red business outcomes" blind spots that create undetected business impact

Timely Escalation:
• Maintained regular communication with Platform Operations and SRE leadership on BOS progress and constraints
• Raised product management resource gap through appropriate channels
• Escalated technical and organizational blockers when they impacted delivery timelines

Regulatory and Governance:
• No errors or compliance issues during evaluation period
• All work aligns with enterprise observability governance and centralized tooling standards
• BOS delivery contract model establishes clear accountability preventing governance gaps

# WORKDAY FIELD 4: Overall Summary

This year I delivered substantial progress establishing business observability as a strategic capability for mortgage lending and consumer technology. Key accomplishments include exceeding the email alert reduction stretch goal (98% vs 80% target, 92% volume reduction) and building the BOS framework positioned for year-end pilot launch.

The BOS work required learning product management, requirements gathering, and UX design skills while simultaneously executing the engineering work. I responded to mid-year manager feedback by adopting faster delivery cycles and shipping consumable artifacts iteratively (templates, dashboards, mockups) rather than waiting for perfection.

Strong cross-functional engagement across Product, Development, Platform SRE, and Executive levels generated recognized value. Manager feedback noted the work was "well received from peers across Technology organization" with continued appreciation for "skills, execution, and institutional knowledge."

Going forward, I'll continue developing presentation skills to better match message to audience, strengthen requirements gathering capabilities as BOS scales, and maintain execution momentum while building frameworks that enable systematic adoption across hundreds of applications.

I demonstrated Company Expectations through candid problem identification (business health vs troubleshooting confusion), advocacy for proper operational practices (email alert elimination), iterative execution responding to feedback, continuous learning (user story mapping research), and inclusive collaboration across organizational boundaries.
