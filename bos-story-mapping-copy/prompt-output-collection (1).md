# Story mapping prompt used to generate the sections below:  Output 1 - 4
Role: You are a senior product coach and story-mapping facilitator.

Objective:
Generate a BOS capability-oriented user story map (Activities → Steps → Stories).  
Use multiple source documents (design iterations, work context, etc.) to inform needs, but always generalize into BOS product capabilities.  
Provenance must be captured as references, listed in a References section (bibliography style) at the bottom.

Input Package (I will provide):
- `Product intent:` one-sentence scope
- `Personas:` list (e.g., Product Owner, Developer, Platform SRE, Director)
- `Docs:` each with
  - DocID: <short ID, e.g., PRD-01>
  - Title: <title>
  - Excerpts: <quoted sections or summaries with anchors: page/section/line>
- `Scope level:` walkthrough draft | full map
- `Constraints:` BOS terms only; plain, direct language

Method:
0. **Doc Acknowledgement**  
   List DocIDs and one-line scope for each (so the user can confirm you read them).

1. **Clarifying Questions (if needed)**  
   Ask up to 5 high-impact questions ONLY if ambiguity could materially change the map. If unanswered, continue with best-effort assumptions.

2. **Parse Docs**  
   Extract BOS-relevant concepts such as:  
   - Business outcomes, success/failure criteria  
   - Signals (business, process, system)  
   - Thresholds/targets, readiness checks  
   - Roles and ownership  
   - Governance/completeness (coverage, versioning, export/import)  
   Extend categories if new types appear in documents.

3. **Create Story Map**  
   - Activities (3–6). Default to BOS backbone (*Define Outcomes → Instrument Signals → Validate → Communicate*).  
   - Allow new activities to emerge if strongly supported by documents.  
   - Steps (2–5 per activity).  
   - Stories (1–3 per step, written in capability language).  
   - Tag stories into capability slices:  
     - Cap-1 = MVP skeleton (one outcome, three signals, one threshold, one readiness view)  
     - Cap-2 = Breadth (extend to multiple steps, reusable templates, roll-ups)  
     - Cap-3 = Completeness/Governance (coverage metrics, outcome registry, export/import)  
     - Cap-4+ if sources justify additional slices.  

4. **Provenance**  
   Assign sources for each story, but do not clutter inline. Instead, list them in a **References section** at the bottom (DocID#Anchor). Each story must trace to at least one source.

5. **MVP Slice Proposal**  
   Frame in capability language. Include 3 bullets in *premise + justification* style.

Rules & Style:
- Always use capability language (no domain-specific examples unless explicitly requested).  
- Keep story text uncluttered; provenance is bibliographic.  
- Default to BOS ontology (outcomes, business/process/system signals, thresholds, readiness), but **extend if docs justify**.  
- Prefer generalizing from work context rather than literal restatement.  
- No emojis, plain operational language.

Deliverables:
A) Doc Acknowledgement  
B) (Optional) Clarifying Questions  
C) Story Map (Markdown tables) — Activities → Steps → Stories, with slice tags (Cap-1, Cap-2, etc.)  
D) MVP Slice Proposal (capability-framed, premise + justification)  
E) Traceability Table (optional, if detail is needed)  
F) References (bibliography) — list of DocIDs, anchors, and how they informed capabilities  
G) Gaps & Risks — missing concepts, unclear ownership, conflicts  
H) Assumptions Log — only if clarifying questions unanswered

Quality Bar:
- Coverage: each activity has 2–5 steps; each step 1–3 stories  
- Sliceability: Cap-1 is always a full end-to-end skeleton  
- BOS alignment: Outcomes → Signals → Validation → Communication always present **unless docs justify extensions**  
- Provenance: every story ties to at least one doc, shown in References
Use the background files and conversation context to populate the Input Package.

## D) MVP Slice Proposal

**Cap-1: Skeleton BOS Implementation**

- **Single end-to-end flow premise:** Teams need immediate value from one complete business process with basic observability—this proves the system works and builds confidence for expansion
- **Essential artifact generation justification:** Mini reference cards and dashboard panels are the minimum viable artifacts that connect business context to operational monitoring—without these, signals remain disconnected from outcomes
- **Clear ownership model rationale:** Every signal and KPI must have an assigned owner from day one to prevent accountability gaps that plague traditional monitoring approaches

## D) MVP Slice Proposal (Cap-1)

**Capability Focus:** Establish minimal end-to-end BOS skeleton demonstrating complete signal triangulation for one business step.

**Justification:**
- **Premise:** Fortune 50 organizations lack systematic business-to-technical observability alignment  
  **Justification:** Creates immediate value by proving triangulation diagnostic capability reduces incident response time

- **Premise:** Current monitoring shows green dashboards during business failures  
  **Justification:** Business signal provides missing stakeholder impact visibility even with minimal implementation

- **Premise:** Teams struggle with ownership accountability during incidents  
  **Justification:** Clear persona-based signal ownership eliminates confusion about response responsibilities

- Graph database capabilities mentioned but not architecturally defined

**Risks:**
- Mental model transformation requires significant organizational change management

**Activities (backbone):** Define Outcomes → Instrument Signals → Validate Readiness → Communicate & Act → Govern & Evolve

## Activity 1 — Define Outcomes

| Step                | Stories (capability language)                                                      | Slice |

| Outcome registry    | Register a business outcome with KPI name, formula, target, and accountable owner. | Cap-1 |
|                     | Version and deprecate outcome records with change history.                         | Cap-3 |
| Step model          | Map flow → stages → steps and link each step to one or more outcomes.              | Cap-2 |

| Step                | Stories                                                                          | Slice |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |

| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----- |
| Mini reference card | Generate a mini card (why it matters, KPIs+targets, signals by type, alerts, responsibilities). | Cap-1 |
| Dashboard panel     | Render a one-step panel with metrics grouped by signal type and inline owners.                  | Cap-1 |
| Alerts → actions    | Route conditions to actions and channels using role-aware responsibility tables.                | Cap-2 |

# D) MVP Slice Proposal (Cap-1 end-to-end)

**Premise:** Start with a thin vertical slice that proves outcome→signals→readiness→communication for one step.

* **Define one outcome with target and owner** so thresholds can drive readiness; this is mandated by the validation checklist and artifact design.&#x20;
* **Instrument three signals (business, process, system) with inline owners** to establish coverage and accountability. &#x20;
* **Publish a one-step readiness view (mini card + dashboard panel)** so teams can act and leaders can see status. &#x20;

# G) Gaps & Risks

* **Coverage metrics**: No explicit formulae for “readiness score” across steps—define a minimal, explainable aggregation. (Implied by checklist gating without a scoring model.)&#x20;
* **Versioning scope**: Governance artifacts imply change tracking but do not prescribe schema—risk of inconsistent logs across teams.&#x20;
* **Owner drift**: Role expectations are defined, but enforcement relies on facilitators; add system-level checks to prevent ownerless signals.&#x20;
* **Alert-to-action mapping**: Mini card/TC mention responsibilities, but escalation paths and channels are not standardized—codify defaults.&#x20;
* **SAFe visibility**: Adoption cadence is described; ensure artifacts carry PI tags so dashboards reflect program progress.&#x20;

---

# H) Assumptions Log

* BOS backbone (Outcomes → Signals → Validation → Communication → Governance) stands unless superseded by future domain docs.&#x20;
* Cap-1 targets one step with one KPI and three signals; Cap-2/3 broaden scope and add governance depth. &#x20;
