### Meeting Update Script (Enhanced)

“Let me give you a quick update on Business Observability.

We’ve made a key pivot. Early on, we struggled to make progress with product teams on identifying and agreeing on critical flows. The conversations with L3 product owner managers have been positive — they’re enthusiastic and aligned — but getting deeper engagement with the L1 delivery teams has been difficult, given how focused they are on execution. That created a gap in getting product-led priorities.

Rather than stall, we pivoted. We’re now building on the start-of-day flows that already exist — about forty of them, established a few years ago. These flows carry implicit business context, and they give us a solid foundation to move forward right now.

Some flows are uncontested and easy to agree on, like funding services through wire transfers and TRID document generation. We’ve met with each L3 lead to validate the existing set and get feedback, and that’s giving us a starting point to expand.

The other big change is that we’ve found existing telemetry and signals that already capture business context — things like document upload success rates, borrower document match percentages, and wire processing success. That means we can expose stakeholder expectations and impacts without requiring code changes. Developers will only need to help us write the queries to power the dashboards.

We’re on track to deliver by October 31st. And to be clear, this is not a pilot or a demo — it’s the enterprise-level lens for CT. The hierarchical dashboard will let us navigate from CT, into each sub-line of business, then into L3 products and their critical flows, with signal coverage, health, and incidents all visible, and with links to playbooks and owners.

Alongside this, C’s value stream mapping work continues to make progress, and when those flows are ready, they’ll plug into the same framework.

So in short: we recognized the challenge of relying on product-led prioritization, we pivoted to leverage what already exists, we’re surfacing business-context signals without code changes, and we’re committed to showing the enterprise dashboard on October 31st.”

Good call — that adds a “what’s next” operational angle without cluttering the main story. You don’t need to rewrite the whole script; you can weave it in naturally at one of two points:

---

**Option 1 — After describing the pivot to start-of-day flows**

> “Rather than stall, we pivoted. We’re now building on the start-of-day flows that already exist — about forty of them, established a few years ago. These flows carry implicit business context, and they give us a solid foundation to move forward right now. *We’ll take the flows where there’s clear agreement and, balanced with high-priority commitments like OCP, put them through the factory process one at a time.*”

This placement strengthens the pivot story by immediately explaining how you’ll operationalize the flows.

---

**Option 2 — In the “short summary” wrap-up at the end**

> “So in short: we recognized the challenge of relying on product-led prioritization, we pivoted to leverage what already exists, we’re surfacing business-context signals without code changes, and we’re committed to showing the enterprise dashboard on October 31st. *And from here, we’ll take the agreed start-of-day flows — balanced with high-priority commitments like OCP — and run them through the factory process one at a time.*”

This placement keeps the body of your script unchanged and ends with a forward-looking, concrete next step.

Do you want me to integrate this line **directly into the script** in both spots so you can see how it flows out loud, or do you prefer to keep it as a note you can drop in depending on how much time you have?
