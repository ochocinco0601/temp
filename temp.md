| *Identify and record outcome* <br> PO: record outcome "Payment validated and queued" <br> Dev: link outcome to technical flow | *Define business signal* <br> PO: define "Payment Status" signal <br> PO: add SLA-related signal | *Establish threshold* <br> SRE: set ≥99% validation success threshold <br> SRE: ensure threshold triggers correctly | *Provide readiness view* <br> Director: readiness tile "Payment Validation Green/Red vs SLA" <br> PO: hierarchy tree view (process → steps → signals) |
| *Document success/failure criteria* <br> SRE: define machine-usable success/failure criteria | *Define process signal* <br> Dev: map "Process Checkpoint (Pending input)" <br> Dev: add "Schema Check Passed" checkpoint | *Confirm completeness* <br> Director: review readiness % across signals | *Enable export* <br> SRE: export step definitions to CSV |
